# Schema Domain Lifecycle Counter

This file tracks the total number of WRITE cycles that have specifically impacted the 'schema' domain.

**Current Count:**

0

---
## Usage
- This counter should be incremented by 1 after every successful WRITE phase that modifies one or more files within the `schema` routeScope.
- It is used by `/protocols/file_lifespans.md` to trigger `reread`, `prune`, or `merge` actions specific to the schema domain.
- Do not edit this file manually. It is managed by the ContextCascade system.

---
## Integrity
- Expected value: A non-negative integer.
- Monotonically increasing.

---
## Next Steps
-After you read this file in full, read all the cascade/lifecycle/security.md
-You will likely have to come back in here to update the Current Count section incrementally.
