# Security Lifecycle Counter

This file tracks the total number of WRITE cycles related to high-risk actions or security events, such as modifications to protected files or security policy changes.

**Current Count:**

0

---
## Usage
- This counter should be incremented by 1 after every successful WRITE phase involving operations flagged with `requiresReview: true`, modifications to files in `/cascade/security/`, or changes to `immutable` files after override.
- It is used by `/protocols/file_lifespans.md` to trigger `reread`, `prune`, or `merge` actions specific to security-related contexts, potentially more aggressively.
- Do not edit this file manually. It is managed by the ContextCascade system.

---
## Integrity
- Expected value: A non-negative integer.
- Monotonically increasing.
