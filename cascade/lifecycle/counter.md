# Global Lifecycle Counter

This file tracks the total number of WRITE cycles that have occurred across the entire ContextCascade system.

**Current Count:**

0

---
## Usage
- This counter should be incremented by 1 after every successful WRITE phase, regardless of the domain(s) affected.
- It is used by `/protocols/file_lifespans.md` to trigger global `reread`, `prune`, or `merge` actions.
- Do not edit this file manually. It is managed by the ContextCascade system.

---
## Integrity
- Expected value: A non-negative integer.
- Monotonically increasing.
