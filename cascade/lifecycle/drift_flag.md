# Drift Flag

**This file indicates a potential inconsistency or drift in the ContextCascade system.**

Its presence signifies that an unexpected state or behavior was detected, such as:
- A hash mismatch for an `immutable` or `protected` file.
- A lifecycle counter not incrementing as expected.
- A validator detecting a schema diff from a known snapshot.
- An unexpected file modification or deletion.

## Action Required
- **System Behavior:** The ContextCascade system may halt or enter a safe-hold mode when this file is present. Normal operations might be suspended until the drift is investigated and resolved.
- **Investigation:** Review `/audit/meta_audit.md` for detailed logs related to the detected drift.
- **Resolution:**
    1. Identify the cause of the drift.
    2. Take corrective actions as per `/cascade/protocols/recovery.md`. This might involve restoring files, correcting metadata, or acknowledging a deliberate change.
    3. Once the system state is verified and consistent, this flag file should be deleted or cleared as part of the recovery process.

## Content
This file may contain a brief, human-readable summary of the detected drift if generated by the system. Be very short and only log items where drift is/may be detected.

**Detected Drift (if any):**

No drift detected. System nominal.
