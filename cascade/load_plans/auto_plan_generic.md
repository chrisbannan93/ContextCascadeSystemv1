# Auto-Generated Load Plan (Generic)

This file specifies the set of files to be loaded into context for the next READ phase. It is typically generated by the AI during the ACT phase of the previous cycle.

This is a generic placeholder. Specific load plans might be scoped by domain (e.g., `auto_plan_client.md`) or task.

---
## Files to Load:

- `/cascade/00_BOOTSTRAP.md`
- `/cascade/index.md`
- `/cascade/system_manifest.md`
- `/cascade/protocols/loop_protocol.md`
- `/cascade/protocols/file_lifespans.md`
- `/cascade/lifecycle/counter.md`
- `/cascade/change_log/recent.md`
- `/cascade/job_logs/recent.md`

*(This list should be dynamically generated based on the current task, routeScope, token budget, and lifecycle triggers.)*

---
## Instructions for AI:
- During the ACT phase, evaluate the needs for the next cycle.
- Generate a new file (or overwrite an existing one like this) in `/cascade/load_plans/` that lists the precise files required.
- Consider `routeScope`, `readPriority` from file metadata, `ttlCycles` of existing plans, and overall token budget.
- This plan will be consumed at the start of the next READ phase.
- If `ttlCycles` expires, this plan may be automatically pruned.
