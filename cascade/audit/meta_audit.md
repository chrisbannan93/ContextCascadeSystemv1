# Meta Audit Log
Record anomalies, blocked writes, and recovery steps here. Each entry should include a timestamp and short description.

| Timestamp (UTC) | Event | Details |
|-----------------|-------|---------|
| _(example)_ `2025-06-25T12:00Z` | `hashMismatch` | Detected change in `system_manifest.md`; WRITE aborted. |

Append a new row for every safeguard violation, manual security review, or recovery action. These entries provide the forensic trail for troubleshooting and compliance audits.
