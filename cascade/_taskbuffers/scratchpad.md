# Scratchpad

This is a temporary buffer for notes, draft content, or intermediate thoughts relevant only to the current prompt or execution cycle.

---
## Usage
- Feel free to write any transient data here during the ACT phase.
- The content of this file is not guaranteed to persist beyond the current READ-ACT-WRITE cycle.
- It will be automatically deleted or cleared after 1 cycle (`ttlCycles: 1`).
- Do not store critical or long-term information here. Use appropriate logs, domain files, or summaries for that.

*(Content here is ephemeral and will be overwritten or deleted frequently)*
