# Client Domain Index
List client-facing memory documents and planning files here. Add rows for new files to keep routing accurate.

|------|---------|
| `overview.md` | High-level goals for the client UI |
| `style_guidelines.md` | CSS and component conventions |

Update this index whenever a file is added or removed from the client domain.
