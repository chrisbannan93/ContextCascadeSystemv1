# Client Application Architecture

This document outlines the architectural design, patterns, technologies, and key structural decisions for the `[Client Application Name, e.g., "WebApp Core", "Mobile Client"]` application. Its purpose is to provide a guiding reference for development and ensure consistency.

---
## 1. Overall Client Architecture

*   **Architectural Pattern(s):**
    *   `[e.g., Component-Based Architecture using React with functional components and Hooks.]`
    *   `[e.g., Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) for structuring UI logic with Vue.js.]`
    *   `[e.g., State Management: Utilizes a Redux-like pattern (specifically Redux Toolkit) for predictable global state management.]`
    *   *Rationale (Optional):* `[Briefly explain why these patterns were chosen if significant, e.g., "Chosen for component reusability, clear data flow, and strong community support."]`

*   **High-Level Module Breakdown:**
    *   `[Provide a diagram or a list of major UI sections, features, or modules. Describe the primary responsibility of each.]`
    *   Example:
        *   **Authentication Module:** Handles user login, registration, session management.
        *   **Dashboard Module:** Main landing area after login, displaying key metrics and navigation.
        *   **User Profile Module:** Manages user settings, preferences, and public profile information.
        *   **Product Module:** Handles product listing, product details, search, and filtering.
        *   **Checkout Module:** Manages the shopping cart and order placement process.
        *   **Shared Components Library:** Common UI elements (buttons, forms, modals) used across modules.

*   **Core Framework/Library:** `[e.g., React 18.2, Angular 16.0, Vue 3.3, SvelteKit 1.20]`
*   **Primary Language & Version:** `[e.g., TypeScript 5.1, JavaScript (ES2022)]`

---
## 2. Component Strategy

*   **UI Component Library/Design System:**
    *   `[e.g., Material UI v5, Ant Design v5, Bootstrap 5.3, Tailwind CSS v3.3, Custom In-house Design System named 'ProjectUnicornComponents']`
    *   *Link to Documentation (if applicable):* `[URL to design system/library docs]`
*   **Component Granularity Philosophy:**
    *   `[e.g., "Adherence to Atomic Design principles (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages) for structuring components."]`
    *   `[e.g., "Favor small, focused, reusable functional components with clear props and responsibilities."]`
    *   `[e.g., "Container components handle logic and data fetching; Presentational components handle UI rendering."]`
*   **Styling Approach:**
    *   `[e.g., CSS Modules for component-scoped styling.]`
    *   `[e.g., Styled-Components (CSS-in-JS) for dynamic and themeable styling.]`
    *   `[e.g., SCSS/SASS with a BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) naming convention.]`
    *   `[e.g., Tailwind CSS utility classes for rapid UI development.]`

---
## 3. State Management

*   **Global State Solution:**
    *   `[e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Vuex, NgRx, React Context API with useReducer hooks.]`
    *   *Core Entities:* `[Briefly describe its core entities, e.g., "Stores for different data domains (auth, cart, products), Actions to describe events, Reducers to handle state transitions, Selectors for optimized state retrieval."]`
*   **Local Component State:**
    *   `[e.g., "React's useState and useReducer hooks are used for UI-specific state that doesn't need to be shared globally (e.g., form input values, modal visibility)."]`
*   **Data Fetching & Caching Strategy for State:**
    *   `[e.g., React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management, including caching, background updates, and optimistic updates.]`
    *   `[e.g., SWR for data fetching and caching.]`
    *   `[e.g., Apollo Client for GraphQL interactions, managing both remote and local state.]`
    *   `[e.g., Custom hooks wrapping native fetch or Axios for API calls, with manual caching where necessary.]`

---
## 4. Routing

*   **Routing Library:** `[e.g., React Router v6, Vue Router v4, Angular Router]`
*   **Route Structure Overview:**
    *   `[e.g., "Routes are defined centrally in `src/routes.tsx`. Major sections of the application utilize lazy loading (e.g., `React.lazy`) to improve initial load time."]`
    *   `[e.g., "Nested routing is used for features like User Profile > Settings > Notifications."]`
*   **Route Guards/Authentication:**
    *   `[e.g., "Protected routes requiring authentication are wrapped in a higher-order component that checks for a valid session/token from the global auth store. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page."]`

---
## 5. API Interaction

*   **Primary Method:** `[e.g., RESTful APIs, GraphQL, WebSockets for real-time features]`
*   **Client-Side API Layer/Service:**
    *   `[e.g., "A dedicated API service module (`src/services/api.ts`) using an Axios instance with pre-configured base URL, headers (including Authorization), and interceptors for request/response handling."]`
    *   `[e.g., "Generated GraphQL client hooks (e.g., from Apollo Codegen or GraphQL Code Generator)."]`
*   **Authentication with Backend:**
    *   `[e.g., "JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are obtained upon login and stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookie managed by backend, or in-memory with secure refresh mechanisms). The JWT is sent in the Authorization header (Bearer scheme) for all authenticated API requests."]`
*   **Error Handling for API Requests:**
    *   `[e.g., "Global API error handling via Axios interceptors to catch common errors (401, 403, 5xx). Component-level error handling for specific request failures to display user-friendly messages."]`
    *   `[e.g., "Use of a notification system to display toast messages for API errors."]`

---
## 6. Build & Deployment (Brief Overview)

*   **Build Tool:** `[e.g., Vite, Webpack 5, Parcel, Angular CLI, Next.js/Nuxt.js build system]`
*   **Key Build Optimizations:** `[e.g., Code splitting per route, tree shaking, asset compression (gzip/Brotli), lazy loading of non-critical assets, PWA generation.]`
*   **Environment Variables:** `[e.g., "Handled via `.env` files and `process.env` (or framework-specific equivalents like `import.meta.env` for Vite), with distinct configurations for development, staging, and production."]`
*   **Hosting Environment (Conceptual):** `[e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3/CloudFront, Azure Static Web Apps, Docker container served via Nginx/Node.js server.]`

---
## 7. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Testing:**
    *   *Framework:* `[e.g., Jest with React Testing Library, Vitest, Mocha/Chai]`
    *   *Typical Targets:* `[e.g., Individual components (rendering, basic interactions), utility functions, state management logic (reducers, selectors), custom hooks.]`
    *   *Coverage Goal (Optional):* `[e.g., "Aim for >80% unit test coverage for new logic."]`
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   *Approach/Tools:* `[e.g., React Testing Library for testing interactions between multiple components, Mock Service Worker (MSW) for mocking API responses.]`
    *   *Typical Targets:* `[e.g., User flows involving multiple components within a feature (e.g., form submission and validation), interactions between UI and state management.]`
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   *Framework:* `[e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium]`
    *   *Key User Flows Covered:* `[e.g., User registration and login, core feature walkthrough (e.g., creating an order), critical path functionalities.]`
