# Client Application - Key Design Decisions Log

This document records major architectural and technical design decisions made throughout the lifecycle of the `[Client Application Name, e.g., "WebApp Core", "Mobile Client"]` application. Its purpose is to provide historical context, understanding of trade-offs, and rationale for why the system is built the way it is.

New decisions should be appended to this log. While past decisions are recorded for history, if a decision is later superseded, a new entry should be made referencing the old one.

## Decision Log Format:

Each entry in this log should follow a consistent format:

```markdown
---
**Decision ID:** `[YYYYMMDD-ShortDescription or SequentialID]`
**Date:** `YYYY-MM-DD`

**Decision:**
`[A concise statement of the decision made. E.g., "Adopt React Query for server state management."]`

**Context/Problem:**
`[Describe the problem or situation that prompted this decision. What issues were being faced? What alternatives were considered? E.g., "Managing server state (caching, background sync, optimistic updates) with Redux Thunks and manual logic was becoming complex and error-prone. Alternatives considered included SWR, Apollo Client (though we are primarily REST), and continuing with custom Redux logic."]`

**Rationale/Justification:**
`[Explain why this specific option was chosen. What are the expected benefits? E.g., "React Query provides robust out-of-the-box solutions for caching, background data synchronization, optimistic updates, and request deduplication, significantly reducing boilerplate and complexity. It has strong community support and good performance characteristics."]`

**Key Stakeholders/Participants (Optional):**
`[e.g., "Client Dev Team Lead, Senior Frontend Engineers, Product Owner"]`

**Consequences/Trade-offs (Optional but Recommended):**
`[What are the known trade-offs or potential downsides? E.g., "Introduces a new library dependency. Team needs to learn React Query's specific patterns and APIs. Initial setup might require refactoring existing data fetching logic."]`

**Link to Supporting Documents (Optional):**
`[e.g., "ADR-005-Server-State-Management.md", "Research Notes: Server State Libraries Comparison", "Architecture.md section on State Management"]`

## Logged Decisions:

---
**Decision ID:** `20230115-InitialFrameworkChoice`
**Date:** `2023-01-15`

**Decision:**
`Adopt React (with TypeScript) as the primary UI framework for the new client application.`

**Context/Problem:**
`The project required a modern, component-based JavaScript framework for building a rich, interactive user interface. Alternatives considered included Angular and Vue.js. Key requirements were strong community support, availability of skilled developers, performance, and a robust ecosystem of supporting libraries.`

**Rationale/Justification:**
`React was chosen due to its large and active community, extensive ecosystem (state management, routing, testing), component-based model promoting reusability, and the team's existing familiarity with its core concepts. TypeScript was included to improve code quality, maintainability, and reduce runtime errors through static typing.`

**Key Stakeholders/Participants (Optional):**
`CTO, Lead Architect, Client Dev Team representatives.`

**Consequences/Trade-offs (Optional but Recommended):**
`React's unopinionated nature means more decisions need to be made regarding supporting libraries (e.g., for routing, state management). JSX learning curve for new developers unfamiliar with it. Performance can be a concern if components are not optimized correctly (memoization, virtualization).`
