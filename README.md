# Context Cascade

## 🚀 Overview

**Context Cascade** is a robust, modular, file-based memory and protocol system designed to augment persistent context management for AI coding assistants. Its primary aim is addressing memory limitations common in environments like Replit by externalizing architectural, behavioral, and decision-making context into clearly structured markdown files.

This structured external memory system enforces consistency, traceability, and durability of context across prompts, effectively bridging the gap between short-term ephemeral AI memory and long-term project coherence.

---

## 🎯 Key Problems Solved

Traditional AI coding assistants often encounter critical issues, including:

- Loss of architectural coherence across prompts
- Redundant component regeneration
- Architectural drift and inconsistencies
- Misaligned assumptions causing bugs
- Token budget constraints leading to memory management issues

Context Cascade systematically addresses these issues through an external memory approach that captures and maintains critical context externally.

## ⚙️ Core Principles

### 🔄 Read → Act → Write Loop

The disciplined three-phase operational cycle:

- **READ**: Load contextual files and validate metadata.
- **ACT**: Logical reasoning and preparation of intended changes.
- **WRITE**: Apply changes securely, with comprehensive validation.

### 📚 Metadata Enforcement

Structured JSON metadata headers define file behavior, lifecycle rules, and validation requirements, ensuring consistent treatment and system integrity.

### 🚦 Lifecycle Management

Automated lifecycle counters and policies manage context freshness, prune expired data, and maintain memory efficiency.

### 🔐 Security and Integrity

SHA-256 hashing, immutable files, protected sections, and rigorous validation prevent unauthorized modifications and detect unintended changes.

### 🌐 Domain Routing

Files and actions are scoped by logical domains (e.g., client, server, schema) to optimize token budget use and maintain clear boundaries.

---

## 🚧 Getting Started

1. **Bootstrap Initialization**

   - Every session begins by reading `00_BOOTSTRAP.md`.

2. **Core Files**

   - Explore the system’s structure via `/cascade/index.md`.
   - Review system rules in `/cascade/system_manifest.md`.

3. **Loop Protocol**

   - Study `/protocols/loop_protocol.md` to fully understand the operation cycle.

---

## 🛠 Placeholder Use Cases

### ✅ Bootstrap Example

A new Replit session initializes by first reading `00_BOOTSTRAP.md`, validating file hashes, and establishing baseline integrity before proceeding to user prompts.

### ✅ Lean-mode Query Example

AI reads only minimal necessary context from `index.md` to handle a lightweight query, optimizing token efficiency.

### ✅ Domain Extension Example

Developers introduce new domains through secure processes involving job plans, validator approvals, and updates to `system_manifest.md`.

## 🧩 Canonical File Types

- `permanent`
- `immutable`
- `rolling`
- `append-only`
- `temporary`
- `counter`
- `evictable`
- `protected`
- `structural`

These types govern lifecycle behaviors, memory management, and operational rules.

---

## 🔗 Contributions and Extensions

- New file types, domains, or lifecycle counters follow a strict extension pattern workflow, involving validation, approval, and secure implementation.
- Contributions must pass rigorous metadata validation (`validators/metadata_validator.md`).
