# ContextCascadeSystemv1

The system aims to:

Externalize and preserve architectural, behavioral, and contextual memory in a structured, lifecycle-managed file system so that AI can operate as if it has long-term, persistent memory—even across fragmented sessions.

Key Objectives:
Durable Memory: Retain key decisions, constraints, architectural rules, and past actions in .md files.

Structured Execution Loop: Enforce a disciplined READ → ACT → WRITE protocol before any changes are made.

File Lifespan & Refresh Control: Optimize memory by using lifecycle counters and thresholds to determine when files are re-read or evicted.

Minimize Drift & Mistakes: Prevent architectural contradictions and careless rewrites via protections like hash validation, file gates, and job plans.

Token-Aware Efficiency: Manage which files get loaded based on smart load plans to stay within token limits.

Change Traceability: Log every action, update, and plan through rolling logs and append-only summaries.

Composable & Extensible: Allow seamless integration of new domains, counters, and external systems while preserving consistency.

Ultimate Vision:
To bridge the gap between stateless AI prompts and a guided, memory-augmented AI partner capable of maintaining architectural integrity, long-term project memory, and efficient planning—without requiring persistent native memory.

In short: Context Cascade turns the file system into memory for stateless AI.
